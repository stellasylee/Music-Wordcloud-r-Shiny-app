#Need a function to interactively create a dataframe (demoFreq) including word and freq in each column
#will be applied inside the server
#Have the default one done beforehand (for all the data)
#Column->unlist? takes a vector and collapses into character string->tally the words in that string

#Move Lyrics into a separate vector

#Create Decade Variable

#Experiment with colors
#Experiment with shapes/outlines
